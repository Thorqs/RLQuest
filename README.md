# Overview
This program is designed as a tool to help with keeping track of the user's various projects as well as helping them stay active on said projects.
We aim to do this by combatting analysis paralysis by the program choosing a task for the user to work on based on categories, time of day, and deadlines.
As the project develops, this decision making will likely become more advanced and more platforms targeted.
A desktop application is the current goal, likely in the form of an overlay that keeps next steps visible without getting in the way of the work itself.
This functionality would be much like a quest log in a computer role playing game, hence the name "RLQuest".
We have no problem working on quests in games and the same should be true of real life pursuits.

# Specifications
To keep this project as cross-platform as possible, and in anticipation of potential future functionality, we will be primarily using python 3.
Godot is another candidate previously examined as it is a cross-platform open-source game engine and thus UI programming should be less intense.
