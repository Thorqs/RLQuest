# Overview
A desktop overlay meant to emulate a quest tracker from a computer game.
The theory being that progressing quests in computer games is fun and easy.

# Specifications
Godot 3.2.1 will be the main tool used for development as it supports making desktop applications (even though its main purpose is that of a game engine) and the transparency effects required for RLQuest to work as intended.
Detailed specifications and discussion can be found at https://thorqs.github.io/projects/rlquest.html.
