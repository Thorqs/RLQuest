# Overview
This program is designed as a tool to help with keeping track of the user's various projects as well as helping them stay active on said projects.
I aim to do this by combatting analysis paralysis by the program choosing a task for the user to work on, either randomly from those available, or more intelligently based on categories, time of day, deadlines, etc.
As the project develops, this decision making will likely become more advanced and more platforms targeted.

One of the main inspirations for this project are quest logs in computer game; we have no problem working on quests in games and the same should be true of real life pursuits.
